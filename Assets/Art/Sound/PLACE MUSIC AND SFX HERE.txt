I have not included sound in this repository due to copywright issues.

In order to have sound/music in the game, navigate to Assets/Resources/ScriptableObjects in the Editor and select the MusicClips/SFXClips resource. 

Place music/sfx files in this folder.

Select each corresponding track in the inspector and point it to the appropriate file.

Test and build as normal.
